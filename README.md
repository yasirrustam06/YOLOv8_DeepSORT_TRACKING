# `Introduction to DeepSORT`
  DeepSORT is a computer vision tracking algorithm for tracking objects while assigning an ID to each object. DeepSORT is an extension of the SORT (Simple Online  Realtime Tracking) algorithm. DeepSORT introduces deep learning into the SORT algorithm by adding an appearance descriptor to reduce identity switches, Hence making tracking more efficient. To understand DeepSORT, First Letâ€™s see how the SORT algorithm works.`
